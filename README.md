# my-dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles I use for my Linux installs.

### How to download

Normal `git clone <url>` will not clone the included repositories, so you need to use `git clone --recurse-submodules <url>` instead.

### How to install

You can just run the included 'INSTALL.sh' script to install the required packages and folders at the correct locations. I recommend manually checking the script before running it, for security reasons.
